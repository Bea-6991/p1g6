    "### Step 2: Test APIs for Data\n",
    "* I was assigned the Disney API & the IMDB API to test for our project\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disney Movies\n",
    "* PK found a project done by another group that used a Disney Movie API.  I went to check it out, but the link to the API in the project is no longer active.  I did some further googling to see if they moved it somewhere else and there does not seem to be a comparable one that I can connect to.  Disney does have open source API access but not to the movies, they just list projects that are currently in development and it appears that you have to be employed by Disney to access the API now.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IMDB\n",
    "* RapidAPI - Access movie and TV information similar to the official one. Get Title, Year, Metascore Rating, IMDB rating, Release date, Runtime, Genre, Directors, Writers, Actors, Plot, Awards, Posters,etcâ€¦\n",
    "    * I have accessed the RapidAPI site and there are many options for how to access the data\n",
    "    * Most requests require an id.  The two request types that will give you the id require a string query, so getting the IDs for large sets of random movies will be problematic\n",
    "* The official IMdB API is accessed through Amazon.  I have emailed a request for accessing the official API (7/5 3:19pm)\n",
    "    * received a response from IMdB, they have TSV files that can be downloaded to use for education\n",

    "* In my search for the Disney API, I cam across another website that had the top 10 movie APIs (https://www.programmableweb.com/news/10-most-popular-movies-apis/brief/2019/05/19)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vimeo - This is for ametuer video, so it does not really apply to our project\n",
    "1. Rotten Tomatoes - I was very excited to find this one because it fits perfectly into one of our case studies, but \"Please note that at this time we no longer support unauthorized use of our data (e.g. unofficial projects, non-user facing data integrations).\"\n",
    "1. The Movie Database - this one is already assigned to Abla to explore\n",
    "1. Dailymotion - Like Vimeo, it does not apply to our project\n",
    "1. Internet Archive - ??? \n",
    "1. New York Times Movie Reviews - there does not appear to be any numerical value assigned to the reviews, only text.  This one would be more complicated to integrate and we would probably have to do keyword searchs in the articles to discover whether the review is good or bad.\n",
    "1. OMDb - this one is already assigned to Oscar to explore\n",
    "1. Trailer Addict - only has Movie Trailers, does not apply to our project\n",
    "1. Film Crave API - ???\n",
    "1. ErosNow Partner - Bollywood only\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* These is also a link to 140 movie APIs if we need more to explore (https://www.programmableweb.com/category/movies/api)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Acquire Data (1_movie_df.ipynb)\n",
    "#### APIs used\n",
    "* TMDB API (The Movie Database API)\n",
    "* OMDB API (Open Movie Database API)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process to Acquire\n",
    "1. Using 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie' which allows filtering on our criteria\n",
    "    * this API call only allows 10,000 items returned per call\n",
    "    * had to set 20 different start dates to get all the movies since 1990\n",
    "    * had to loop through the start dates, then loop through the multiple pages of the results\n",
    "    * acquired only the tmdb ids (proprietary info for this API) from these API calls\n",
    "    * saved the list of ids to a text file so these calls would not have to happen again (191,138 ids)\n",
    "1. Using https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{id} which allows pulling information about a single movie\n",
    "    * tried looping through all ids one at a time to pull imdb_id, budget, and revenue information\n",
    "        * code crashed after 3 hours, lost all progress\n",
    "    * broke the list into 8 chunks of 25,000 ids, looped through one chunk at a time and output each chunk to a separate csv file (continued running overnight, took over 8 hours to complete)\n",
    "    * looped through the 8 csv files and loaded them all into the same dataframe (566032 rows - definitely some duplicates in the chunks)\n",
    "    * dropped any row that contained an NA in any of the three fields (imdb_id, budget, revenue) (424,967 rows)\n",
    "    * removed any rows that had a value of 0 for revenue or budget (39,499 rows)\n",
    "    * save to a csv file\n",
    "    * drop duplicate imdb_ids, keeping only the first instance (5,484 rows)\n",
    "1. Random Number generator\n",
    "    * generate a list of 1200 random numbers (had to go back and add code to avoid repeats) that were in the range of 0 - 5484 (the length of the dataframe)\n",
    "    * using the list of random numbers as a reference to the index of the dataframe, added the imdb_id at that index to a list\n",
    "1. Using http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey={api_key_omdb}& which allows pulling information about a single movie\n",
    "    * looping through the 1200 ids, did an API request on the imdb_id\n",
    "    * checked criteria, if met criteria, then appended the following data to the dataframe\n",
    "        * title, rated, release date, runtime, genre, language, awards, metascore, imdb rating, imdb votes, imdb id, box office returns, production company\n",
    "    * stopped after 600 ids met criteria\n",
    "1. Using the 600 record OMDB dataframe, filtered the TMDB dataframe (budget & revenue) to have the matching records\n",
    "1. Merged the OMDB and TMDB dataframes together on the IMDB_id\n",
    "1. check for duplicate titles\n",
    "    * one found, \"The Lion King\", filtered for the title and found that it was two separate releases, the original animated version and the more recent live action version\n",
    "1. Saved final dataframe to a csv file to use to begin cleaning the data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Clean Data (clean_data.ipynb)\n",
    "1. Loaded csv generated above into a dataframe\n",
    "1. Checked for similar, but not exact matching values in the individual columns, discovered and corrected this issue in the \"Rated\" column\n",
    "1. Removed the text from the \"Runtime\" & \"imdbVotes\" columns and converted the values to numbers instead of text\n",
    "1. Filtered out movies with a runtime less than 60 min and budgets less than 10,000\n",
    "1. Removed BoxOffice, Metascore, and duplicate IMDB_id columns (insufficient data to be useful)\n",
    "1. Looked for NA values in any field, discovered and removed those records\n",
    "1. Calculated and add a column for ROI% (Return on Investment percentage)\n",
    "1. Saved the clean data to a csv to be used for analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Analysis\n",
