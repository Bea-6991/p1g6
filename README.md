# p1g6: What makes a movie succesful?
❏	Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.


❏Hypotheses:

Highly budgeted movies return high revenue and profit

Highly budgeted movies have a high popularity

❏Criteria for Movies:

  Theatrical release in the US
  
  Released on 1990 or later
  
  Budget of over $10,000
  
  Runtime longer than 60 minutes

❏Factors to take into consideration:

    Movie Length
    
    Genre
    
    Rating
    
    Awards
    
    Production Company
    
    Budget
    
❏Evidence in the data supports the first hypothesis, but not the second.
    As a production company allocates a significant amount of capital for a movie's budget, the results are mainly projected from a financial standpoint. Movies with elevated budgets tend to outperform those that didn't have the same economic resources. For a movie, securing a high budget means that there will be an overall higher production value than a movie that a significantly lower budget. However, this does not assure the production company that the movie will be popular. Popularity was difficult to factor that cannot be measured with just numbers. It was to do with the artistic value the movie might have. All in all, with the data recolected and our analysis, we can conclude that having a higher budget presents the movie with a greater chance for it to break even and have a greater profit percentage.
